# Movie-Recomender-System
This is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's past movie ratings, watch history, and other relevant data to generate a personalized list of movie recommendations.
# Installation
To use the movie recommendation system, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official Python website. Additionally, you will need to install the following packages:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip, which is the default package installer for Python. Open the terminal and type the following command:
!pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
# Usage
To use the movie recommendation system, you will need to have a dataset of movies and their attributes such as genre, director, actor, storyline, etc. You can obtain a dataset from various sources such as IMDB, Netflix, or Kaggle. The dataset should be in CSV format, with each row representing a movie and each column representing an attribute.

Once you have the dataset, you can run the recommendation.py file, which will generate a personalized list of movie recommendations based on the user's past movie ratings and watch history. The user's data should be in CSV format, with each row representing a movie and each column representing a rating.
To run the recommendation system, open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the recommendation.py file is located. Then, run the following command:
python recommendation.py --movies movies.csv --users users.csv --output recommendations.csv
